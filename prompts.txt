Of course. Here is a set of questions designed to test the different areas of knowledge you have scraped. They are categorized by the type of reasoning they
  will test in your AyurMind system, from simple data retrieval to complex, multi-agent diagnosis.

  Category 1: Testing Fundamental Principles (Sutra Sthana)
  These questions test basic RAG retrieval and understanding of core Ayurvedic concepts.

   * "What are the fundamental principles of Ayurveda according to the Sutra Sthana?"
   * "Explain the concept of 'tridosha' (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) and their primary qualities."
   * "What is the importance of 'dinacharya' (daily routine) for maintaining health?"
   * "Describe the six tastes ('rasas') and their effects on the doshas."

  Category 2: Testing Diagnostic Abilities (Nidana Sthana)
  These questions test the Dosha Imbalance Detector agent's ability to connect symptoms to diseases.

   * "What are the primary causes and premonitory signs of 'Jvara' (fever)?"
   * "I have a persistent sour taste in my mouth and a burning sensation in my chest. Which dosha imbalance does this point to according to Nidana Sthana?"
   * "Describe the five stages of disease pathogenesis, from 'sanchaya' to 'bheda'."
   * "What are the causes of 'Raktapitta' (bleeding disorders)?"

  Category 3: Testing Constitutional Assessment (Vimana & Sharira Sthana)
  These questions test the Prakriti Assessor agent's ability to determine constitutional type based on user descriptions.

   * "How is an individual's 'Prakriti' (constitution) determined at the time of conception, as explained in the Sharira Sthana?"
   * "I have a tendency to gain weight, my skin is oily, and I have a calm, steady personality. What might my dominant dosha be?"
   * "According to the Vimana Sthana, what factors should be examined to understand a patient's constitution and current state of health?"
   * "Explain the relationship between the mind ('sattva', 'rajas', 'tamas') and the physical constitution."

  Category 4: Testing Treatment & Therapy Recommendations (Chikitsa, Kalpa, & Siddhi Sthana)
  These questions test the Treatment Recommender agent's ability to suggest therapies.

   * "What is the recommended 'shodhana' (purification) therapy for a strong person with a severe Kapha imbalance?"
   * "Describe the procedure and benefits of 'Basti' (therapeutic enema) as detailed in the Siddhi Sthana."
   * "What are the formulations and uses of 'Amalaki' as described in the Chikitsa Sthana?"
   * "What dietary guidelines are recommended for someone suffering from 'Atisara' (diarrhea)?"

  Category 5: Complex Scenarios (Testing the Full Orchestrator Workflow)
  These are multi-part questions designed to test the entire agentic pipeline, from assessment to treatment recommendation and synthesis.

   * Scenario A (Vata Imbalance): "I am a 35-year-old artist. I am naturally thin, have dry skin, and my mind is always racing with ideas. Recently, I've been
     experiencing anxiety, insomnia, and cracking joints. Analyze my likely Prakriti and current Vikriti (imbalance), and suggest a plan with both diet and
     lifestyle changes to bring me back to balance."
   * Scenario B (Pitta Imbalance): "A 45-year-old manager complains of frequent acid reflux, skin rashes, and irritability. He has a sharp intellect and is a
     natural leader but gets angry easily. Based on these signs, what is his probable constitution and imbalance? What therapeutic principles from the Chikitsa
     Sthana would be most effective for him?"
   * Scenario C (Kapha Imbalance): "I feel sluggish and heavy, especially in the morning. I have gained weight recently, have a slow digestion, and suffer from
     sinus congestion. Please identify the likely doshic issue and recommend both a purification procedure (from Siddhi Sthana) and some herbal preparations
     (from Kalpa Sthana) to help."
